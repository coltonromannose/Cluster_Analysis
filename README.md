# Cluster Analysis



 I used a dataset developed by IBM data scientists which was used to look at factors related to employee job satisfaction and attrition. The original dataset is accessible through Kaggle. 

 Objective: Your business question is: “How can our 
 company effectively target strategies to improve employee satisfaction to specific groups of 
 employees based on their characteristics and performance?”

The first step to creating those strategies is to segment the company’s 1,470 employees into clusters based on key characteristics and performance indicators. 

 Variables: The variables I used for this analysis are:
 Age: Age of employee in years
 MonthlyIncome: How much the employee earns per month
 PercentSalaryHike: The percentage increase in salary over two years
 YearsAtCompany: The total number of years the employee has been with the company


 # Part one: Segment customers using the four variables Age, MonthlyIncome, PercentSalaryHike, YearAtCompany.
